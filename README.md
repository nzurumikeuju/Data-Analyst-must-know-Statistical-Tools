# Data-Analyst-must-know-Statistical-Tools
A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating 10 core statistical tools for data analysts using a real dataset
Whether you're analyzing customer behavior, optimizing operations, or building predictive models, statistical testing is at the heart of informed decision-making.

Here are the top 11 tools I believe every data analyst should have in their toolkit:

1. Descriptive Statistics – Summarize the key features of your data
2.  Skewness Testing – Understand asymmetry and data distribution
3.  Histogram – Visualize data distribution and detect skew/outliers
4.  Boxplot – Detect outliers and understand data spread at a glance
5.  T-Test – Compare group means (e.g., male vs female scores)
6.  Z-Test – Compare sample mean to a known population mean
7.   Chi-Square Test – Examine relationships between categorical variables
8.  Linear Regression – Predict continuous outcomes
9.  Correlation Analysis – Measure the strength and direction of relationships
10. A/B Testing – Test which version performs better (e.g., test prep vs no prep)
11. Outlier Detection - Test to identify anomalies that may distort your analysis
    
Mastering these tools will help you not just understand data — but explain it, test it, and act on it.
